21664,december 1998,December.n,0,December.n: the twelfth month of the year. Patterns like: Calendric_unit.April.n,Calendric_unit,"Calendric_unit: Words in this frame name the different parts of the calendric cycle, both man-made and natural. The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).",0
21665,your contribution to goodwill will mean more than you may know .,may.v,9,may.v: used to express possibility~$~may.v: expressing possibility,Possibility~$~Likelihood,"Possibility: A Possible_event is deemed to have all pre-conditions satisfied; in other words, it has some probability of occurrence, if some (generally implicit) further Condition pertains.  The Condition, whether overt or implicit, often concerns the decision of an agent to attempt to bring the Possible_event about. The primary implication is that certain other aspects of the situation that might have been expected to prevent the Possible_event, usually lack of capability or permission, do not pertain.  'You ca n't burn glass . INI' 'You can have two more if you want .' 'This sense of lack can never be satisfied .' 'We just ca n't stand it anymore . INI'  This frame is confusable with the Capability frame, which specifically involves an Agent who is presented as needing only the decision to perform an Action in order to successfully perform the Action.~$~Likelihood: This frame is concerned with the likelihood of a Hypothetical_event occurring. The Hypothetical_event is its only core frame element.  'It is likely that he'll arrive late.'  Notice that in the case where a noun phrase is the subject of the Support Verb, that NP is also tagged as Hypothetical_event.  'He is likely to arrive late.'",1
21666,your contribution to goodwill will mean more than you may know .,contribution.n,1,contribution.n: something that is given towards an effort or cause,Giving,Giving: A Donor transfers a Theme from a Donor to a Recipient.  This frame includes only actions that are initiated by the Donor (the one that starts out owning the Theme).  Sentences (even metaphorical ones) must meet the following entailments: the  Donor first has possession of the Theme.  Following the transfer the Donor no longer has the Theme and the Recipient does. 'Barney gave the beer to Moe.' '$300 was endowed to the university to build a new performing arts building.',0
21667,your contribution to goodwill will mean more than you may know .,know.v,10,"know.v: be familiar or friendly with.~$~know.v: to hold a belief with confidence of its truth. Only in Certainty when there is contrastive stress on target; otherwise, belongs in Awareness.~$~know.v: be aware of through observation, inquiry, or information. This verb is factive - speaker believes the proposition whether or not he is the subject.~$~know.v: distinguish (usually of the form X knows Y from Z)",Familiarity~$~Certainty~$~Awareness~$~Differentiation,"Familiarity: An Entity is presented as having been seen or experienced by a (typically generic and backgrounded) Cognizer on a certain number of occasions, causing the Entity to have a certain degree of recognizability for the Cognizer.  'Susanna Fulton's work is new to me.'  'Two of these frames were new to me as a beginning professor.'  'This was as new to him as the rest of the outcity.'  'JSON is fairly new to me as a data format.'  'Moreover, this way of describing and categorizing architecture is familiar to most people.'  'Coronaviruses are not unfamiliar to the epidemiological world.'  'Abbey Stadium will bring us into contact with one familiar face at least.'~$~Certainty: This frame concerns a Cognizer's certainty about the correctness of beliefs  or expectations. It only includes uses where a Cognizer is expressed.  'Lermontov was certain he would come to the party.'~$~Awareness: A Cognizer has a piece of Content in their model of the world.  The Content is not necessarily present due to immediate perception, but usually, rather, due to deduction from perceivables.  In some cases, the deduction of the Content is implicitly based on confidence in sources of information (believe), in some cases based on logic (think), and in other cases the source of the deduction is deprofiled (know).  'Your boss is aware of your commitment.' '' Note that this frame is undergoing some degree of reconsideration.  Many of the targets will be moved to the Opinion frame.  That frame indicates that the Cognizer considers something as true, but the Opinion (compare to Content) is not presupposed to be true; rather it is something that is considered a potential point of difference, as in the following:    'I think that you are awesome.'  In the uses that will remain in the Awareness frame, however, the Content is presupposed.  '' This frame is also distinct from the Certainty frame, in that it does not profile the relationship of the Cognizer to the Content, but rather presupposes it.  In Certainty, the Degree of confidence or certainty is expressible as a separate frame element, as in the following:  'She absolutely knew that he would be there .'~$~Differentiation: Words in this frame have to do with a Cognizer being aware (or not being aware) of the difference between two Phenomena, which may be expressed jointly or disjointly.      'It is very difficult for people to visually distinguish between living and non-living things from such a great distance .'",2
